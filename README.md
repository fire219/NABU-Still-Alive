## Build
Make sure you have Z88DK installed to a known location. Copy included NABULIB to directory above this source code. Change the paths in build.bat to match your setup, and then run it. Restart (real or emulated) NABU as needed.

## Thanks
- DJ Sures for NABULIB and for doing most of the leg work for resurrecting this forgotten 80s computer.
- Valve, Jonathan Coulton, and Ellen McLain for funny cake game
